Enhance the UI design for the AI comparison tool to improve spacing, alignment, and overall layout to make it closely resemble the previously uploaded screenshot. Focus on the following improvements:

1. Spacing and Alignment
	•	Add more spacing between the columns (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude) to ensure the layout feels less cramped.
	•	Vertically align all content (titles, icons, and input areas) to maintain consistency across all columns.
	•	Adjust padding around the Model Instructions area to create a cleaner and more breathable design.

2. Icons and Headers
	•	Ensure the icons (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI, Claude) are consistently sized and vertically aligned with the titles.
	•	Add slight padding between the icons and titles for better readability.
	•	Center-align the settings and sync icons above each column while ensuring equal spacing between these icons and the titles.

3. Input Area
	•	Increase the vertical padding for the text input field to make it larger and more inviting.
	•	Add a subtle border or background color to the text input field for better visual separation.
	•	Center the send button (arrow icon) vertically in relation to the input field and adjust spacing for a clean look.

4. Column Borders
	•	Add light, subtle vertical dividers between each column to visually separate them while maintaining a cohesive layout.

5. Overall Aesthetic
	•	Use a clean and modern font with consistent sizes across all elements (titles, instructions, input fields).
	•	Slightly increase the width of each column to fill more horizontal space without overlapping.
	•	Ensure responsiveness so the UI scales elegantly across different screen sizes.

6. Header Layout Consistency
	•	Move the sync and settings icons directly to the top-right corner of each column header for a cleaner and more professional look.
	•	Add consistent padding above and below the header section.

7. Test the Design
	•	After implementing the changes, test the design on desktop and mobile views to ensure all elements remain visually appealing and functional.

Make these updates and ensure the UI aligns with the professional and minimalistic style of the previously uploaded screenshot.
